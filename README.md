## How do I Install The translation?

### For iOS
**# Download Instructions
### Note: all methods for applying the mod are iOS only and there are no current plans for Android methods**
### Note: Before doing any of this you need to make sure you have Puni installed and the data download downloaded. If you do not know how to get Puni, I recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ubJk8XewFw)

Sideload PureKFD, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Lrdsnow/PureKFD/releases)

Inside PureKFD, go into the settings and change the exploit to whatever one suits your device (Direct Write for Jailbroken and Trollstore, MDC for 15.0 to 16.1 one, KFD for 16.1 to 16.6 beta 1.

Open PureKFD, then go into the browse tab, then click on the plus in the top right corner.

Into the Add Repo box simply copy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lit8tech/PureyOSPatch-Default-Repo/refs/heads/main/purekfd.json

Then press on the yOS Yo-kai Watch Mod Repo and select Yo-kai Watch Puni Puni: English Translation! (Images 1/2) and Yo-kai Watch Puni Puni: English Translation! (Images 2/2) for translated images and Yo-kai Watch Puni Puni: English Translation! (Extras) for Strings, Cuds and the Videos.

Then go into the installed tab and and click install tweaks.

Once installing is done for all of them, click apply, as mentioned earlier, make sure wireguard vpn is on if your using sparserestore and make sure you don't have sidestore open. If your using Sparerestore and the app crashes when applying, install and apply all three tweaks individually.

Once it says tweaks have been successfully applied you can press reboot and everything will be done! Puni will be translated

### For Android
Currently there is no application method for Android, but a cool team is working on creating a custom Puni server reimplementation on Android, with plans of eventually reviving Wibble Wobble on device, so if you interested please join their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/r4B4WVyBJU)
